This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to install the Advanced Network Scanner Tool, ensuring you have everything needed to get started with comprehensive network analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Advanced Network Scanner Tool, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
- **Network Access**: Sufficient permissions to scan the network, as network scanning operations may require administrative privileges.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the Advanced Network Scanner Tool repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfuchs01/advanced-network-scanner.git
```

This command downloads the latest version of the tool from the GitHub repository.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory where the repository has been cloned:

```bash
cd advanced-network-scanner
```

In this directory, you will find all the source code, documentation, and other files related to the project.

## Step 3: Install Required Dependencies

The tool requires several Python packages to run. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the listed packages.

## Step 4: Verify Installation

To verify that the tool is installed correctly and is operational, you can run a quick version check or start the tool in a testing mode, if available. For example:

```bash
python -m gui.main_window
```

If the graphical interface launches successfully, the installation is correct.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, consider the following common troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure your Python version is 3.6 or higher.
- Check your network permissions and firewall settings, especially if scans do not run correctly.
- Revisit the `requirements.txt` file to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Consult the FAQ section for solutions to common problems.

For further assistance, raise an issue on the GitHub repository, detailing the problem and any error messages you have received.
